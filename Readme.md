# Typescript_OOP_Concepts

This project is an interactive command-line application that demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in TypeScript. The program allows the user to interact with a `Person` and dynamically manage a list of `Student` objects.

## Features

- **Self Interaction**: Simulate a conversation with a virtual person representing yourself.
- **Student Management**: Interact with a list of students by dynamically adding new students and conversing with existing ones.
